After compiling \dftfe{} as described above, we have now the \verb|real/main| executable, which uses real data-structures for the Kohn-Sham DFT eigen solve. This is sufficient for fully non-periodic problems, and periodic and semi-periodic problems with only one Brillouin zone sampling point at the origin. The other executable is \verb|complex/main|, which uses complex data-structrues for the Kohn-Sham DFT eigen solve. This is required for periodic and semi-periodic problems with multiple Brillouin zone sampling points. These executables are to be used as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
  ./main parameterFile.prm
\end{verbatim}
or, for a parallel program:
\begin{verbatim}
  mpirun -n N ./main parameterFile.prm
\end{verbatim}
to run with N processors. In the above, an input file with \verb|.prm| extension is used. This file contains user-defined parameters as described in Section~\ref{sec:parameters}. For the structure of the input \verb|.prm| file, please follow the examples in the \verb|/dftfe/demo/| folder.
