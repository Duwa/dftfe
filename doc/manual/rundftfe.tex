The \verb|real/main| executable uses only real data-structures, which are sufficient for fully non-periodic problems, and periodic and semi-periodic problems with only one Brillouin zone sampling point at the origin. The \verb|complex/main| executable uses complex data-structrues which are required for periodic and semi-periodic problems with multiple Brillouin zone sampling points.
